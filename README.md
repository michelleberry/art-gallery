# Michelle's Art Gallery
For a while I had the idea to make a website gallery to showcase my best artworks, and this is my *first* attempt at doing so. 
It was made using django ( a web framework tool ) and soon I might try to make it a real web site. 

## Running the art gallery
### Prerequisites
- you have python installed
- you are connected to the internet (otherwise, bootstrap will not load and this will not look very nice!)

### Instructions: 
1. make a python virtual environment in same directory as project folder. let's just call it, venv:
   python -m venv venv
2. run the venv - venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
3. make sure django is installed in the venv *(im not completely sure if this step is necessary)*  : pip install Django
4. cd to directory that contains the manage.py (cd my_art_gallery)
5. run server by typing command: python manage.py runserver 
6. open a browser and type into the searchbar: localhost:8000/artworks/

- this is how to run on windows powershell, may be different command on different OS / shell 
- to quit running the server: press ctrl + c at any time. 

## Other Details
All of the artwork featured in this project is 100% my own handmade original art, sometimes I would look
from references but NEVER trace or copy things. I would like to make a better banner for the website 
in a future update.
